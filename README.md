### Test Case Details

## Pytest Essential Notes & Commands

- You can install Pytest using pip with the command: pip install pytest. This will download and install the latest version of Pytest from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
- To write a basic test, create a Python file starting with test_ (e.g., test_sample.py). Define a function starting with test_ (e.g., def test_addition():) and use assertions to check the expected outcomes (e.g., assert 1 + 1 == 2).
- To run pytest in headed mode you can type command ``` pytest --headed ``` (default headless mode). To show/ print the output if avaiable you can type the command ``` pytest --headed -s ```.
